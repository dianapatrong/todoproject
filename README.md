# To-do list
This project will resemble a to-do list where you can track all of the tasks that you need to complete, the user will be
able to create, update and delete tasks in the list. 

This basic application is written in Python, it uses Django web framework and Postgres as the database. 

## Django
Django runs on an Model View Template system:

**Model**: Sets out the schema for our database. With Djangoâ€™s ORM, you can declare the fields, field types, etc. 

**View**: Set all of your code logic and algorithms, you can get results from the database or manipulate some data, it basically 
expects a request and a response. 

**Template**: Plain HTML code with Django's Template Language in it.

**Settings**: Holds all the settings of your web app.

**Url**: It helps to connect the view to a url.

**Admin**: Deals with how you want to view your models in the django admin.

## Setup local environment 

Install postgress
Install requirements 

## CI/CD
**GitHub Actions** is a continuous integration that makes it easy to automate all your software workflows. 
It builds, test and deploys code right from GitHub.

> NOTE: I had used Travis CI but after a few issues with the provisioning of builds out of knowhere
> I decided to change to GitHub Actions

**Heroku** is a cloud platform that lets you build, deliver, monitor and scale applications. For this app, Heroku
was configure to deploy the application after a merge to master from a PR. 

For this project, the workflows are described in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows), there are two different types:
* Run unit tests: will only run on Pull Requests and when a merge to master happens
* Deploy to Heroku: will only run when there's a merge to master 


Useful commands: 
* `heroku run bash -a todolist-dsti-devops` 
* `psql $DATABASE_URL`

## Infrastructure as Code
**Vagrant** is a tool for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments, it 
also has integration with **Ansible** as a provisioner for these virtual machines. 

### Step-by-step: 
1. Install Virtualbox
2. Install Vagrant
3. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:dianapatrong/todoproject.git` and `cd todoproject`
4. Run: `vagrant up`
5. Wait for it to provision and the app will be running on: http://20.20.20.2:8000/


## ERRORS
